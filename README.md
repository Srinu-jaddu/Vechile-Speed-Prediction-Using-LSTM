# Vechile-Speed-Prediction-Using-LSTM

Traffic Prediction LSTM Model:

Introduction:

This code implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for traffic prediction based on historical traffic data. It leverages Python along with libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and matplotlib for data manipulation, preprocessing, model construction, evaluation, and visualization.

Code Details:

1. Import Libraries:
   The necessary libraries are imported to facilitate data processing, model building, and visualization.

2. Loading the Data:
   Traffic data is loaded from an Excel file, typically containing information about traffic flow, occupancy, and speed.

3. Feature Selection/Engineering:
   Relevant features are selected from the dataset for further analysis.

4. Data Visualization:
   The selected features are visualized over time to gain insights into traffic patterns.

5. Normalization/Feature Engineering:
   Data normalization is performed to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, enhancing the model's performance.

6. Sequence Creation Function:
   A function is defined to create sequences for input into the LSTM model, ensuring that the temporal dependencies in the data are captured effectively.

7. LSTM Model Building:
   LSTM models are constructed for both short-term and long-term traffic prediction tasks. The architecture consists of LSTM layers followed by a dense layer.

8. Model Training:
   The LSTM models are trained using the provided data, with separate models for short-term and long-term predictions.

9. Model Evaluation:
   The trained models are evaluated using test data, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to assess their performance.

10. Visualization of Results:
    The actual and predicted values are visualized to analyze the model's performance visually, both for short-term and long-term predictions.

Conclusion:

This code demonstrates the utilization of LSTM models for traffic prediction, offering insights into future traffic patterns based on historical data. It can serve as a valuable tool for traffic management and planning purposes, aiding in decision-making processes related to infrastructure and resource allocation.
